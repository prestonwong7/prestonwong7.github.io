    <h2> Cerebot </h2>
    <p> Cerebot is a program I colloaborated creating in human-I-T. I collaborated in creating an automated program in Python that implements Google Drive and Asana API to attach Google Drive files into Asana tasks. It uses OAuth 2.0 as an authentication and authorization tools for safe, multiple employee usage Cerebot is written in Python. One of the main methods I helped with Cerebot is by writing hundreds of test cases to minimize bugs. I also debugged many of the errors such as not searching properly as well as duplication errors. </p>

In Mobile RPG, you are a prince who will be going through an intense plot of saving your dad from evil slimes! Grow stronger as you level up, gaining more hp, attack damage, and more! </p>
