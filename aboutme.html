    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <hr size="10">
    <p> My name is Preston Wong and I currently go to California State University Long Beach as a computer science major. I am twenty years old
        and one of my main goal is to create a video game. If not, I would want to work at a Big N company as a software engineer, or a game developer 
        if possible. Game developing is a difficult job these days, as there's not a enormous salary and also very stressful, as with most jobs. 
        </p>
    <h2> Hobbies</h2>
    <p> One of the sports I love playing almost every day is basketball. I have been playing basketball for over ten years, and hope to one day coach or teach kids. The player I love watching the most is Steph Curry, because not only do I shoot as far as him, but his dribbling and ball handling skills is something I would love to achieve in the near future.</p>
    <p> Another sport I play currently is table tennis and badminton. At my university, I am the president of both the table tennis and badminton club. I used to think that being a president is really simple and easy, such as signing a few papers and delegating positions. However, I couldn't be more wrong, especially leading over twenty members of the club. I also recently got into badminton because my ping pong friends convinced me for a long time to try out badminton. Apparently, the badminton club had been shut down for a while, so I revived the club. Turns out, badminton is one of the most entertaining sports I played in a while. Table tennis and badminton are both so much fun! </p>
    <h2> Goals </h2>
    <dl type = "1">
    <dt>Work</dt>
    <dd>1. Work at a game company such as Blizzard! I truly love their games. Ever since I was little, I have always been planning to work at their company. The first game I played was Starcraft by them. Watching professional Korean players dominate this field is truly a spectacle to watch. </dd>
    <dt>Creating a Game</dt>
    <dd>2. Create a game where it requires fast APM, but first person. Very intensive and action based game. Probably won't happen in a while. </dd>
